# CS50-problem sets
My solutions to CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science problem sets
##
Here I have posted my solutions to Harward CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science problem sets. The original tasks and initially provided code can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/ under each week. These problem sets cover abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Problems are solved using C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages.
